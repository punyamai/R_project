# In this project, I have cleaned the data to solve some important questions and made a visualized chart to know the trend of the data.
## I have downloaded the data source from this link https://data.world/aroissues/forbes-global-2000-2008-2019
library(dplyr)
library(readxl)
library(tidyverse)

df <- read_excel("ForbesGlobal2000-2022.xlsx")
view(df)
## Check that this data set does not have na variable.
is.na(df)
head(is.na(df)) #is.na(df) has many outputs, so I will show only a few of them.
mean(is.na(df))
### 0 mean do not have na value
## Which country has the most Forbes companies?
df_country <- df %>%
  group_by(Country) %>%
  summarise(n=n()) %>%
  arrange(desc(n))
df_country$Country[1]
### The United States has the most Forbe companies.

## Which five countries have the most market value?
df_country_market <- df %>%
  select(Country, Market_Value) %>%
  group_by(Country) %>%
  summarize(total_market_value = sum(Market_Value)) %>%
  arrange(desc(total_market_value))
head(df_country_market, 5)

## Which industry has the most companies?
df_industry <- df %>%
  group_by(Industry) %>%
  summarize(total_num = sum(n= n()))
df_industry[1,1]
## Plot the histogram of prices
ggplot(df, aes(Profits)) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 30, fill ="orange")+
  theme_minimal()+
  labs(title = " Price Histogram",
       )
### The distribution of prices is right-skewed.

## Plot the sales correlation with profits.
ggplot(df, aes(x= Sales, y = Profits, col = Profits)) +
  geom_point(size = 2, alpha= 0.8) +
  scale_color_gradient(low = "gold", high = "purple") +
  labs(title = "Sales correlation with profit") +
  theme_minimal() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm",
              col = "black")
### When sales increase, profits also increase.


## Which industry has the best profits?
industry_group <- df %>%
  select(Industry, Profits) %>%
  group_by(Industry) %>%
  summarize(total_pro_indus = sum(Profits)) %>%
  arrange(desc(total_pro_indus))
industry_group[1,1]
### The best industry with the most profit is banking, so I will check the answer with a bar chart.
## Plot the industry correlation with profits.
ggplot(df, aes(x = Industry, y = Profits, fill = Industry == industry_group$Industry[1])) +
  geom_col() +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("TRUE" = "blue", "FALSE" = "#6EF036"),
                    name = "Is the best profits") +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(title = "Industry correlation with profit") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))
